##################################

# WebP Configuration
# Enabled by default, image format of choice with modern web pages/applications.
webp:
  enabled: true
  # Configures the compression type. Valid values are: DEFAULT, LOSSLESS
  compressionType: DEFAULT
  # The higher this number, the likelier it is that the
  # integrated algorithm chooses this image format.
  qualityWeighting: 1.0

# JPEG Configuration
# Enabled by default, most browsers will support the JPEG-format.
jpeg:
  enabled: true
  # Defines the quality of the saved image.
  # Generally, the lower you set this, the smaller
  # the disk space taken by an image will be. However,
  # this comes at the cost of image quality.
  compressionQuality: 75.0
  # The higher this number, the likelier it is that the
  # integrated algorithm chooses this image format.
  qualityWeighting: 0.9

# Bitmap configuration
# Disabled by default, not advised to be used.
bmp:
  enabled: false
  # Defines the quality of the saved image.
  # Generally, the lower you set this, the smaller
  # the disk space taken by an image will be. However,
  # this comes at the cost of image quality.
  compressionQuality: 75.0
  # Bitmap specific compression type. Available options vary by operating system.
  # Thus, it is not advised to use the bitmap processing feature as bitmap
  # is not as portable as other image formats and is not often used in a web-context.
  compressionType: BI_RGB
  # The higher this number, the likelier it is that the
  # integrated algorithm chooses this image format.
  qualityWeighting: 0.5

# GIF configuration
# Disabled by default, may be interesting for legacy support.
gif:
  enabled: false
  # Defines the quality of the saved image.
  # Generally, the lower you set this, the smaller
  # the disk space taken by an image will be. However,
  # this comes at the cost of image quality.
  compressionQuality: 75.0
  # The higher this number, the likelier it is that the
  # integrated algorithm chooses this image format.
  qualityWeighting: 0.7

# PNG configuration
# Disabled by default, most browsers will support PNG.
# However, it is a lossless format and could significantly increase
# the disk space used.
png:
  enabled: false
  # Defines the quality of the saved image.
  # Generally, the lower you set this, the smaller
  # the disk space taken by an image will be. However,
  # this comes at the cost of image quality.
  compressionQuality: 75.0
  # The higher this number, the likelier it is that the
  # integrated algorithm chooses this image format.
  qualityWeighting: 0.8
